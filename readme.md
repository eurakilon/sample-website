# Sample website in PHP
For reusability purpose, I created this all-purpose project, with a simple `src/index.php` file, with a custom "404 not found", a twig implementation with `src/templates`, and a PSR-4 implementation (use of namespaces)

## To launch it
`$ cd [your-folder/src]; $ php -S 0.0.0.0:80` and then go to http://localhost to see the welcoming page
